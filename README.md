- 👋 Hi, I’m @shr3dwin
- 👀 I am interested in Cyber Security and Pentesting
- 🌱 I’m currently active in labs and courses that are improving my skills, knowledge, and practical hands on experience as a Pentester/Ethical Hacker. 
  Some of the courses I've participated in are OFFSEC's Pen-200 Course which I completed 1/3rd of toward the OSCP. I am currently working on my eJPT through
  INE Learning to hone in on some fundamental concepts and practical hands on skills with many labs. I am currently in college with CIAT which is a school 
  that focuses on developing skills hands on with many labs, discussions, quizzes, courses. On top of that the courses are Comptia focused. So far I've done courses
  wrapped around A+, Net+, Sec+, Aws Fundamentals, Azure Fundamentals, MS 365, and have more cloud based architectual training in the near future.
    I am familiar with Linux, Mac, and Windows OS. Another hands on based course I am working on is with HACK THE BOX- Red Team Job Roles path. I've gained a few
  medals for Linux Fundamentals and other courses.
